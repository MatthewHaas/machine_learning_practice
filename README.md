## README for machine_learning_practice
The purpose of this repository is to showcase work that I have done to practice my machine learning skills.

I started off using Jupyter Notebooks to do the work because it was a convenient way to work.

The file [iris_classification.ipynb](iris_classificaiton.ipynb) features a super simple dataset, but since everyone uses it, I thought I might as well do it.

### Project for machine learning course
This file is a Jupyter Notebook file for my machine learning project. It conducts machine learning in the R statistical environment. The data are from a database of rental listings throughout Germany and the aim is to predict rental prices given size of the unit and number of rooms.
